### Total Differential
A total differential equation involves differentials of multiple variables. It expresses how a function \( f(x_1, x_2, ..., x_n) \) changes with respect to each of its variables. The general form of a total differential equation is:

\[
\frac{{\partial f}}{{\partial x_1}}dx_1 + \frac{{\partial f}}{{\partial x_2}}dx_2 + ... + \frac{{\partial f}}{{\partial x_n}}dx_n = 0
\]

Where \( \frac{{\partial f}}{{\partial x_i}} \) represents the partial derivative of \( f \) with respect to \( x_i \).

Let's consider an example to illustrate this concept:

### Example 1:
Suppose we have a function \( f(x, y) = x^2 + y^2 \). We want to find the total differential equation satisfied by \( f \).

First, we compute the partial derivatives of \( f \):
\[
\frac{{\partial f}}{{\partial x}} = 2x
\]
\[
\frac{{\partial f}}{{\partial y}} = 2y
\]

The total differential equation becomes:
\[ 2x dx + 2y dy = 0 \]

This equation expresses how the function \( f(x, y) = x^2 + y^2 \) changes as \( x \) and \( y \) change.

### Example 2:
Consider a thermodynamic system where \( U \) is the internal energy, \( T \) is temperature, and \( V \) is volume. The first law of thermodynamics states:

\[ dU = dQ - dW \]

where \( dQ \) is the infinitesimal heat added to the system and \( dW \) is the infinitesimal work done by the system. We can express this equation in terms of differentials:

\[ dU = TdS - PdV \]

where \( T \) is temperature, \( S \) is entropy, and \( P \) is pressure.

In this example, \( U \), \( T \), \( S \), and \( V \) are all variables, and the equation relates their differentials.

Total differential equations are fundamental in various fields, including physics, engineering, economics, and more, where relationships between multiple variables need to be expressed.
